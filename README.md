## Rules
- In the beginning of the game everyone gets 7 cards. Then a card is drawn from the top of the deck and placed for the first player to play off of. The first player to go is random. A card can only be played if the card on the table is the same color unless the card wanting to be played is a wild. If it is a wild card it can be placed at any time after any card and the player can change the color to whatever they would like. If the player plays a +4 Wild card it works the same except the next player draws four cards. There are also skips, +2's, and reverses. Skips skip the next player, +2's give the next player 2 cards, and reverses change the direction the players play. If the player gets down to their last card they must call uno or they have to draw two cards.
